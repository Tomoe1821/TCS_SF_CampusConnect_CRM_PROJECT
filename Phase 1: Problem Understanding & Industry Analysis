**Project Type:** Salesforce CRM Implementation (Admin + Developer)  
**Target Users:** Students, Club Leaders, Faculty Coordinators, Admin

## Problem Statement  

Student clubs and events on campus are currently managed using scattered tools like Google Forms, WhatsApp groups, and Excel sheets. This leads to:  
- Missed or delayed event updates.  
- Duplicate or invalid registrations.  
- No centralized way to track student participation.  
- Manual effort for faculty coordinators to generate reports.  

---

## Goal  

Implement a Salesforce CRM that:  
- Centralizes student, club, and event data.  
- Automates event registration and reminders.  
- Tracks attendance and generates participation history.  
- Provides dashboards for real-time engagement analytics.

- Centralized platform for managing clubs, students, and events.  
- Automated registration and event reminders.  
- Streamlined attendance & feedback tracking.  
- Dashboards for faculty and coordinators to monitor student engagement.

## Stakeholder Analysis  

| Stakeholder   | Needs / Responsibilities |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Students      | Register for events, receive reminders, view their participation history. |
| Club Leaders  | Create/manage events, track registrations, view attendance, send updates. |
| Faculty       | Oversee multiple clubs, approve budgets, track student engagement. |
| Admin         | Setup org, users, profiles, roles, permissions, and data security. |

## Business Process Mapping  

### Current Manual Process  
- Club shares Google Form links via WhatsApp.  
- Student data manually compiled into Excel.  
- Event reminders sent manually by club leaders.  
- Attendance tracked via paper sheets.  
- Reports created monthly using Excel.  

### Proposed Salesforce Process  
1. Student registers via Salesforce form → captured as Event Registration Record.  
2. Auto-confirmation email/SMS sent to the student.  
3. Salesforce Flow sends reminders 1 day before the event.  
4. Attendance tracked digitally using custom objects.  
5. Participation history available in Student Profile.  
6. Dashboards auto-refresh for real-time engagement insights.

- **Automated Certificates:** Generated after successful attendance.  
- **Budget Approval Workflow:** Faculty approves club event budgets via Approval Process.
